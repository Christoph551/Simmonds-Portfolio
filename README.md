# Simmonds-Portfolio

## Description

This page is intended to be my personal portfolio to showcase recent projects and challenges from my coding bootcamp. I've implemented HTML and CSS to structure and style this page to meet the acceptance criteria of the challenge. 


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The first box shown will be the most recent project that I've worked on. As I complete more work, I will then add those respective links into the additional boxes shown in the "Work" section.
Please note that I have not yet added links to Project 1, Project 3 and Project 4. Once I complete additional projects in the bootcamp, I will update this page accordingly.
Also, I have not had the time to address the issues with the navigation links in the header or get the media queries to operate properly for smaller resolution screens.
